<p>I liked the aspect of a pirate theme but was more partial to sci-fi for this exercise. My father and grandfather alike loved the 'Star Trek' series, so I grew up watching them.</p>
<p>Not everyone is familiar with nor likes sci-fi stories, movies or games but that's ok as the theme can also fit sailing and the sailing of feelts of ships. So it should be common to most people what a captain is, ship, crewmen, fleets, etc. are.</p>
