<p>My theme is about me going on vacation and meeting a couple in which I learned that the wife; was a travel agent. I've always wanted to visit
	Hawaii and this is a story about the events and decissions that lead me through the process of trying to get an affordable trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>I'm sure plenty of others have had to make some tough decissions and check balancing to pulloff a wonderful relaxing getaway. 
	This is some of the thought processes that I went through on my vacation.</p>
